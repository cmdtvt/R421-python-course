'''
The third progam tests a for-iteration. In this program, build a calculator, which asks the user for a number, and calculates the sum of all positive numbers from 0 to the usergiven input. If the user gives the number 4, the program calculates the sum 0+1+2+3, if 7, the calculation is 0+1+2+3+4+5+6. Finally, the program produces an answer with the printout "The sum was:" and an answer.

When working correctly, the program prints something like this:

################
>>> 
Give a number: 3
The sum was: 3
>>> 

Give a number: 5
The sum was: 10
>>> 
################


Keep in mind, that with the for in range-approach, there is always a variable which knows the current round number. Also, in this exercise it is allowed to assume that the user does not give faulty inputs such as letters or empty lines.


################
Example output:
Give a number: 4
The sum was: 6
